\section{Conclusion}
This paper presented an evolution of the game elements and concepts introduced by \pwOne \cite{anvikPW}. Regarding programming concepts, the \Gr card was changed to the \M card to better represent procedures, functions and methods in programs. Also, the the conditional statement concept was made more explicit with the use of gameplay goals. Similarly, the general cybersecurity concepts in \pwOne were specialized in \pwTwoNS. Finally, \pwTwo introduced the concepts of algorithms through the addition of the \Ser and \Sort cards. Regarding gameplay, two modes of play (\B and \StdNS) were introduced to provide a learning path for players, and the user interface was revised to provide more player and game information.  

In the near future, we will be conducting a user study to investigate the effects of \pwTwo on learning fundamental concepts of computer programming and cybersecurity. Also, the next version of \gameName will introduce a gameplay mode focused on teaching the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and the Agile software development methodology.
