\gameName is a web-based card game designed to teach the fundamentals of computer programming and cybersecurity. Unlike previous games, \gameName provides an interactive program-language independent learning environment where the goal of the game is not to solve a maze. Based on informal comments and the results of a formal user study, a number of aspects of the game were revised. First, a number of cards were either removed or refined. Also, cards were added to introduce the programming concept of algorithms and the user interface was improved to provide more information about the players and the game state. Finally, two modes of play were introduced to provide players a learning path that allows for a more gradual introduction of programming language and cybersecurity concepts.
